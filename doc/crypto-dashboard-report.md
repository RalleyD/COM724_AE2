# Cryptocurrency Forecasting Dashboard: Development and Evaluation Report

## Introduction

The cryptocurrency market has experienced significant growth and volatility since its inception, creating both opportunities and challenges for investors, traders, and researchers (Corbet et al., 2019). With over 10,000 cryptocurrencies in existence and a market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion, making informed investment decisions requires sophisticated analytical tools capable of processing vast amounts of data and identifying meaningful patterns (Levi and Lipton, 2022). Traditional financial analysis methods often fall short when applied to cryptocurrencies due to their unique characteristics, including extreme volatility, 24/7 trading, and sensitivity to technological, regulatory, and market sentiment factors (Fang et al., 2022).

This report documents the development of a cryptocurrency forecasting dashboard designed to address these challenges. The dashboard leverages machine learning techniques, real-time data integration, and interactive visualizations to provide actionable insights for cryptocurrency market participants. Unlike conventional financial dashboards, our solution incorporates advanced time-series forecasting capabilities specifically optimized for cryptocurrency price prediction, correlation analysis, and investment decision support.

## Analysis, Evaluation and Results

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

The data pipeline begins with collection from the Binance API, chosen for its reliability, comprehensive coverage of major cryptocurrencies, and granular historical data access (Katsiampa et al., 2023). To ensure system robustness, a fallback mechanism using cached CSV data was implemented for situations where API connectivity is compromised.

The preprocessing workflow consists of several key stages:

1. **Initial Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistent datetime formatting across all datasets.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating technical indicators and derived features that capture market dynamics:
   - Lagged features (1, 3, 5-day) to capture short-term momentum
   - Moving averages (7 and 30-day) to identify trends
   - Volatility measures using rolling standard deviations
   - Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought/oversold conditions
   - Percentage price changes over various timeframes

3. **Sequence Creation**: Generating input-output pairs for model training, with 60-day input windows mapped to 30-day forecast horizons, creating a sliding window approach for multi-step forecasting.

4. **Stationarity Analysis**: Applying time series decomposition and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests to assess stationarity properties of different cryptocurrencies. As identified in the analysis, Bitcoin (BTC) demonstrated non-stationarity with a high p-value, while Binance Coin (BNB) showed more stationary characteristics.

The distribution analysis revealed asymmetric patterns with heavy left or right tails for most cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin showing particularly high kurtosis. These non-normal distributions informed the selection of modeling approaches that could handle such data characteristics.

### Model Selection and Optimization

The model selection process employed a structured evaluation of multiple forecasting approaches:

1. **Baseline Models**:
   - Naive forecasting: Using the last observed value as the prediction
   - ARIMA: Traditional time series forecasting with autoregressive and moving average components
   - Exponential Smoothing: Capturing trends and seasonality through exponential weighting

2. **Advanced Machine Learning Models**:
   - Random Forest with conditional deseasonalization and detrending
   - AdaBoost ensemble methods
   - XGBoost with optimized hyperparameters
   - Prophet (Facebook's forecasting tool)

The evaluation metrics included Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE) to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance.

PyCaret was utilized for efficient model optimization, with a specific focus on the first target day prediction to establish optimal hyperparameters. The optimization process, as illustrated in Figure 1, employed cross-validation with a time-series split to prevent data leakage and ensure realistic performance estimation.

XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships and handle the high volatility characteristic of cryptocurrency data. The model was configured with the following key parameters:

- Subsample: 0.8 (to reduce overfitting)
- Max depth: 4 (balancing model complexity with generalization)
- Learning rate: 0.05 (enabling fine-grained learning)
- Number of estimators: 180 (providing sufficient model complexity)

To facilitate multi-step forecasting, the optimized XGBoost model was wrapped in a MultiOutputRegressor, enabling simultaneous prediction of multiple future time points. This approach, validated through extensive backtesting, demonstrated superior performance compared to recursive single-step forecasting methods.

### Model Evaluation Results

The model evaluation revealed significant performance variations across different cryptocurrencies:

**Bitcoin (BTC)**:
- Multi-step model MAE: 24,084.70
- Multi-step model MSE: 817,797,760.33
- Multi-step model R²: -2.17

**Ethereum (ETH)**:
- Multi-step model MAE: 361.15
- Multi-step model MSE: 214,700.79
- Multi-step model R²: 0.36

**Litecoin (LTC)**:
- Multi-step model MAE: 10.41
- Multi-step model MSE: 235.69
- Multi-step model R²: 0.49

**Binance Coin (BNB)**:
- Multi-step model MAE: 141.15
- Multi-step model MSE: 26,788.53
- Multi-step model R²: -6.54

These results highlight several important observations:

1. **Scale Dependence**: The absolute error metrics (MAE, MSE) vary significantly based on the price scale of each cryptocurrency.

2. **Relative Performance**: When normalized for price levels, Litecoin showed the best predictive performance with an R² of 0.49, indicating that the model captured approximately 49% of the price variance.

3. **Challenging Currencies**: Bitcoin and Binance Coin proved particularly difficult to forecast, with negative R² values suggesting that the model performed worse than a simple mean predictor for these assets.

Further experiments with feature combinations and model configurations revealed that:

1. Using lag-3 features consistently produced better results than using lag-1 or multiple lags combined.

2. Including technical indicators (RSI, moving averages) improved performance for Ethereum and Litecoin but had minimal impact on Bitcoin predictions.

3. The performance discrepancies across currencies correlate with their stationarity properties, supporting the hypothesis that more stationary assets are inherently more predictable.

The final model configuration adopted a currency-specific approach, using the best-performing feature set and hyperparameters for each cryptocurrency. This decision prioritized forecast accuracy over architectural consistency, aligning with the project's objective of maximizing predictive performance.
